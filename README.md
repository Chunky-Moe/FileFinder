This is a very fast, very simple file finder.
You can either run the .exe file from anywhere (CMFF_110.exe), or run the powerscript (CMFF_110.ps1) from Powershell.
Use * as a wildcard. *dog will find all files named either just 'dog' or end in the word dog.
For example, hotdog and dog will be found, but doggone will not.
To find any file with the word dog anywhere in it, use *dog*.
This would return dog, hotdog, doggone, bun.dog and so on.

It will then search every single hard drive (HDD or SDD, USB etc.) that Windows detects and return a list of where these files are located.
It will also output a log file that will show you the exact path and file name to each find.
Output file will be dumped where ever you run the powerscript or .exe from and will be named by Date-Time and Searched Name.log
It can be opened with any simple text editor.

This is freeware, all I ask is you do not sell this, nor bundle this with any products for sale.
It is to be given freely.
